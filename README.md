# CS506 Blender Visualizations

This is a collection of notebooks, and blender python scripts that work in conjunction to create interactive visualizations of data science concepts.


## Environment Setup

NOTE: The version of Numpy within Blender and the local environments must match for the pickling of data to be compatible.

A makefile is provided with the following directives:
- `make install` (Creates virtual environment `venv` with requirements installed)
- `make clean` (Removes virtual environment)
